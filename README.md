## Community Health Files

Community health files stored in `.github` are shared with every Armirage repository. They cover subjects such as a code of conduct or security policy. Content that would be duplicated if kept within each repo.

When a repository is created, it will utilize these guidelines, templates, and policy documentation. Add a README and LICENSE to complete a repository's most basic docs. Additionally, updates to policy will propagate across all repositories.

Default files are not included in clones, packages, or downloads of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.

Individual repositories can override the defaults with custom docs in their own `root`, `.github`, or `docs` folder.

For more details, refer to GitHub Docs.<sup id="anchor-2">[2](#github-docs-note)</sup>
